# Inline Documentation Standards

- Every exported class/function must have a JSDoc/XML summary.
- Use the `loadRemoteRoutes` doc style as the reference.
- Review gate: PRs missing summaries are blocked.

## Angular example

```ts
/**
 * SidebarComponent controls the global navigation and the user account menu.
 * - Emits route navigations via Router
 * - Persists collapsed state in localStorage
 */
```

## .NET example

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Health endpoint reporting service liveness for orchestrators.
/// </summary>
```
