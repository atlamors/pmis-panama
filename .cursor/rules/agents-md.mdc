# Rule
Agents must always reference an `AGENTS.md` file before taking any action.

# Priority Hierarchy
1. **Project-level AGENTS.md files take precedence over the root AGENTS.md.**
   - If an `AGENTS.md` file exists in the same project, package, or service directory as the file being worked on, that file governs the request.
2. **If no project-level AGENTS.md is present, fall back to the nearest ancestor.**
   - Walk upward through parent directories until an `AGENTS.md` is found.
3. **If multiple AGENTS.md files exist, the one closest in the directory tree to the target file always wins.**
   - Closeness is determined strictly by directory depth.
4. **The root-level AGENTS.md applies only when no more specific file is found.**
   - It serves as the global default baseline for the entire monorepo.

# Enforcement
- These rules are absolute and must not be bypassed.  
- Specificity always overrides generality.  
- Root AGENTS.md is a fallback, never a replacement for a more specific file.
